It certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t go the way I expected it to go, but I&amp;rsquo;m still happy with the results.&lt;/p>

I also got to play a very interesting game called Abzu. One of the things that you can do in the game is grab onto the fin of a fish and swim with them. Near the end, the marine creatures that you can ride are pretty impressive.&lt;/p>

If you are able to eat 256 dots in a row, you clear the screen and the game gives you a fun little message. I was able to do it on stream!&lt;/p>
